          <h2 className="mb-2 text-xl font-bold">Setting Study Goals:</h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            To make your study plan effective, set specific and measurable
            goals. Break down larger goals into smaller, achievable targets. For
            instance, aim to master a specific data structure or solve a certain
            number of algorithmic problems within a given time frame. These
            goals will keep you motivated and focused throughout your
            preparation.

          <p className="text-lg">
            Designing a study schedule that fits your available time and
            commitments is crucial. Dedicate regular time slots for focused
            study sessions. Prioritize topics based on your assessment and set
            aside dedicated time for practice interviews and revising key
            concepts. Remember to include breaks to avoid burnout and maintain
            productivity.
